# Inference Instructions

Briefly, you need to:

1. Download a checkpoint
2. Get the code
3. Load the checkpoint
4. Get activations

Details are below.

## Download a Checkpoint

First, download an SAE checkpoint from the [Huggingface collection](https://huggingface.co/collections/osunlp/sae-v-67ab8c4fdf179d117db28195).

For instance, you can choose the SAE trained on OpenAI's CLIP ViT-B/16 with ImageNet-1K activations [here](https://huggingface.co/osunlp/SAE_CLIP_24K_ViT-B-16_IN1K).

You can use `wget` if you want:

```sh
wget https://huggingface.co/osunlp/SAE_CLIP_24K_ViT-B-16_IN1K/resolve/main/sae.pt
```
