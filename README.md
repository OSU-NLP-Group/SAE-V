# saev - Sparse Auto-Encoders for Vision

Implementation of sparse autoencoders (SAEs) for vision transformers (ViTs) in PyTorch.

Originally forked from [HugoFry](https://github.com/HugoFry/mats_sae_training_for_ViTs) who forked it from [Joseph Bloom](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens).

Read [logbook.md](logbook.md) for a detailed log of my thought process.
