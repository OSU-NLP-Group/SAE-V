# Logbook

This provides a set of notes, step-by-step, of my process developing this library.
In combination with code comments and git blame, it's probably the best way to understand *why* a decision was made, rather than *what* decision was made.

Something in the post-training is not working.
I should run the post-training steps (analysis.py and generate_app_data.py) once for a known good checkpoint and once for the new checkpoint that used the dataloader and see if it's an issue with the post-training code or the checkpoint.
Honestly, I'm not sure which one I want to be broken.
Probbaly the post-training code?

I trained a couple SAEs using both my updated codebase and the original codebase.
Like, the original codebase, without even ruff/isort added.
I did this because I figured there were four possible problems:

1. The updated training code is wrong.
2. The updated analysis.py file is wrong.
3. The updated get_app_data.py file is wrong.
4. The random seed was causing problems.

The key is that I now have several checkpoints, trained with the original codebase or with the udpated codebase.
I also have updated and original versions of the other scripts.
So I can take each piece through step by step and see where the mistake is.

| Checkpoint | Updated Training? | Updated Analysis? | Updated App Data? | Worked? |

| 2dlebd60 | No | No | No | Yes |
| 2dlebd60 | No | No | Yes | No[^dataset-shuffle] |
| 2dlebd60 | No | Yes | No |
